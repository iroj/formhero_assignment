<h1 class="md-display-2">Instructions</h1>

<p>To demonstrate your knowledge of JavaScript and AngularJS (or your ability to quickly learn how to write AngularJS Directives / Components) we have put together this mini application.</p>
<p>We would like you to create a directive/component that is a custom Date Input.</p>
<p>This directive/component should be called <b>fh-date-input</b>, should allow <b>fh-data-input</b> to be used as an attribute to instantiate the directive and should meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>req 1</li>
    <li>req 2</li>
</ul>
<p>The next tab, "Your Solution", is already set up to use the new directive, and contains a variety of uses of the directive that should demonstrate it's functionality.</p>
<p>To give you some additional guidance on what the user interface should look like, we are including the following images that visually describe what we expect the widget to look like in various states:</p>
<table class="instructions-table">
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td><img src="./images/initial.png"></td>
        <td><p>When the input is first loaded, and there is no value set for it.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td><img src="./images/month.png"></td>
        <td><p>When the user first click into the month field, a popup/modal should appear, allowing the selection of the month.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td><img src="./images/day.png"></td>
        <td>
            <p>When the month is selected, the view in the modal/popup should automatically switch to allow the selection of the day</p>
            <p>The back-arrow should return the user to the selection for the month.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4.</td>
        <td><img src="./images/year.png"></td>
        <td>
            <p>Once the day is selected, the view should change to allow the user to pick the year. It should allow navigation between decades above the list of years.</p>
            <p>The back-arrow should return the user to the selection for the day.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
